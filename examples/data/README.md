# Data folder

This folder is for the data used in the case studies. 
This folder is empty to keep the repository small. 
You can download the data we used from [Zenodo]()

Data created by the scripts in the repository are stored here.
After you run some of the scripts you will get some files here.
Please do not add them to the repository.
